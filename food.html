                Curry is very popular in the United Kingdom, with a curry house in nearly every town.[38][39] Such is
                the popularity of curry in the United Kingdom, it has frequently been called its "adopted national
                dish".[40] It was estimated that in 2016 there were 12,000 curry houses, employing 100,000 people and
                with annual combined sales of approximately £4.2 billion.[41] </p>

            <p style="color: black;margin-right: 50px;">
                Curry spread to South Africa with the migration of people from the Indian subcontinent to the region in
                the colonial era. African curries, Cape Malay curries and Natal curries include the traditional Natal
                curry, the Durban curry, bunny chow, and roti rolls. South African curries appear to have been founded
                in both KwaZulu-Natal) and the Western Cape, while other curries developed across the country over the
                late 20th century and early 21st century to include ekasi, coloured, and Afrikaner curries.[36] Durban
                has the largest single population of Indians outside of India.[37] Bunny chow or a "set", a South
                African standard, consists of either lamb, chicken or bean curry poured into a tunnelled-out loaf of
                bread to be eaten with one's fingers.[36][37] </p>

                Malaysian cuisine may have initially incorporated curries via the Indian population, but it has become a
                staple among the Malay and Chinese populations there. Malaysian curries typically use turmeric-rich
                curry powders, coconut milk, shallots, ginger, belacan (shrimp paste), chili peppers, and garlic.
                Tamarind is also often used. Rendang is drier and contains mostly meat and more coconut milk than a
                conventional Malaysian curry; it was mentioned in Malay literature in the 1550s by Hikayat Amir
                Hamzah.[33] </p>

            <p style="color: black;margin-right: 50px;">
                Curry spread to other regions of Asia. Although not an integral part of Chinese cuisine, curry powder is
                added to some dishes in the southern part of China. The curry powder sold in Chinese grocery stores is
                similar to Madras curry powder but with addition of star anise and cinnamon.[25] The former Portuguese
                colony of Macau has its own culinary traditions and curry dishes, including Galinha à portuguesa and
                curry crab. Portuguese sauce is a sauce flavoured with curry and thickened with coconut milk.[26] </p>

            <p style="color: black ;margin-right: 50px;">
                ndia is the home of curry, and many Indian dishes are curry-based, prepared by adding different types of
                vegetables, lentils, or meats. The content of the curry and style of preparation vary by region. Most
                curries are water-based, with occasional use of dairy and coconut milk. Curry dishes are usually thick
                and spicy and are eaten along with steamed rice and a variety of Indian breads. The popular rogan josh,
                for example, from Kashmiri cuisine, is a wet curry of lamb with a red gravy coloured by Kashmiri
                chillies and an extract of the red flowers of the cockscomb plant (mawal).[22] Goshtaba (large lamb
                meatballs cooked in yoghurt gravy) is another curry dish from the Wazwan tradition occasionally found in
                Western restaurants.[23]
